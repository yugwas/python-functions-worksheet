You should go through the lessons and complete any necessary code as instructed. 

The questions will eventually be answered in a Google Form, but you are welcome to answer them in this repo and copy/paste them later if you like.

Here are some basic Shell commands that you may need:

**ls** - Lists all files in the current directory  
**cd folder_name** - Changes to another directory  
**cd ..** - Goes "up one level"  
**touch file_name.extension** - creates a file, be sure to include the proper file extension  
**mkdir folder_name** - creates a new folder

There are a ton of other Shell commands, but the above  are the only ones we really need right now.

In order to run a python file in the Shell you must be in the same folder as that file and then type:

**python file_name.py**
