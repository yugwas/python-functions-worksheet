Right now, getting an error, or exception, in your Python program means the entire program will crash. You donâ€™t want this to happen in real-world programs. Instead, you want the program to detect errors, handle them, and then continue to run.

You can view the execution of this program at https://autbor.com/zerodivide/. A ZeroDivisionError happens whenever you try to divide a number by zero. From the line number given in the error message, you know that the return statement in spam() is causing an error.

Errors can be handled with try and except statements. The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause. The program execution moves to the start of a following except clause if an error happens.

You can put the previous divide-by-zero code in a try clause and have an except clause contain code to handle what happens when this error occurs.
