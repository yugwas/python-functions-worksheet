To define a function is to create it, just like an assignment statement like spam = 42 creates the spam variable. The def statement defines the say_hello() function ➊. The say_hello('Al') line ➋ calls the now-created function, sending the execution to the top of the function’s code. This function call is also known as passing the string value 'Al' to the function. A value being passed to a function in a function call is an argument. The argument 'Al' is assigned to a local variable named name. Variables that have arguments assigned to them are parameters.

It’s easy to mix up these terms, but keeping them straight will ensure that you know precisely what the text in this chapter means.
